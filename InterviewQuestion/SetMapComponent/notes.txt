Map vs Object â€“ What's the Difference?

=> When to use map:

With map, you can use any type (and values) as keys.
Map provides better performance for large quantities of data.
Use a map for better performance when adding and removing data frequently.
When to use an object:

Objects can only use numbers, strings, and symbols as keys.
Objects are perfect for small to medium-sized sets of data.
Objects have better performance and are easier to create.


=> Benefits of Sets over Arrays
Arrays and sets are both data structures used for storing collections of elements. But sets have a slight edge over arrays because of:

Uniqueness: With a set, duplicates are removed to reduce the size of the data structure (unlike an array which stores duplicates).
Manipulating collections: It is easy to combine a set with other sets to perform various operations like intersections, unions, and differences.
Performance: Because of the implementation using hash tables, set offers faster lookups and membership tests
