const functions = [
  function(x) { return x + 1; },
  function(x) { return x * 2; },
  function(x) { return x - 3; }
];
You can access any element of the array using its index, which starts from 0. For example, functions[0] will give you the first function, 
functions[1] will give you the second function, and so on.

To call a function that is stored in an array, you need to use parentheses and pass the argument(s) that the function expects.
 For example, functions[0](x) will call the first function with the argument x and return x + 1. 
 Similarly, functions[1](x) will call the second function with the argument x and return x * 2, and 
 functions[2](x) will call the third function with the argument x and return x - 3.

So, in general, functions[i](x) means calling the function at index i of the array functions with the argument x.


Function composition is an approach where the result of one function is passed 
on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is executed for the 
final result. Function compositions can be composed of any number of functions
