How to iterate over an object?
---------------------------------


We can use “for in loop” to iterate over an object but there’s a catch “for in” will iterate 
the whole prototype chain meaning if there’s a key which you are looking for is not on your object but
 it is in your prototype chain it will return it and it’s a costly operation because this loop will iterate
  the prototype chain which you didn’t want we only want to iterate our the object not the whole prototype 
  chain right?




Second option is we can use Object.keys or values which is aham.. 
okay like we can use it but whats the catch? If we use Object.keys then we will get the keys and 
we can get the value by passing obj[key] which is okay but there’s a better intuitive option which 
I’ll explain later another thing is if we use Object.values we will get the values only so whats the better solution if we want keys and values?



“Object.entries” Bingo!!

Object.Entries we can iterate over an object by using Object.entries in “for of loop” in which we can 
destructure the key and value pair that is the intuitive one doesn’t?

Note: Another approach is using symbol.iterator with generator function in that approach 
we can iterate any object without using any object methods but this approach is little bit advanced 
sand it’s not that intuitive that’s why I didn’t mention here.
