Object Constructor

Constructor function in JavaScript is used for creating new objects using a blueprint.
Just like classes are used for creating objects in Java, C# we can use constructors to create objects in JavaScript.

## Objects can be created using the constructor function syntax using the following two steps:

1. Define the object blueprint(class) by defining the constructor function. By convention, name of the constructor function should start with capital letter.

2. Create the object by instantiating the constructor function using new operator.

Example:
function Human(firstName, lastName) {
this.firstName = firstName,
this.lastName = lastName,
this.fullName = function() {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}
}

var person1 = new Human("Virat", "Kohli");

console.log(person1)

## This is just the blueprint. To create the object we will use the new operator.

var viratKohli = new Human("Virat", "Kohli");
var sachinTendulkar = new Human("Sachin", "Tendulkar");
